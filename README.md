# Data Structures Library

This repository contains a collection of commonly used data structures implemented in C++. Currently, it includes implementations of AVL Trees, Union-Find, and Hash Tables.

## Overview

### AVL Tree
An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.

### Union-Find
Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.

### Hash Table
A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

## Features

### AVL Tree

- **Insertion**
- **Deletion**
- **Searching**
- **Balancing**

### Union-Find

- **Union:** Merge two sets into one.
- **Find:** Determine which set a particular element is in.

### Hash Table

- **Insertion**
- **Deletion**
- **Searching**
- **Collision handling (using chaining)**
- **Automatic resizing**

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions for each data structure are available in their respective header files.
